# How to contribute


## Dependencies

We use [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) to manage the dependencies.

To install them you would need to run `install` command:

```bash
poetry install
```

To activate your `virtualenv` run `poetry shell`.


## One magic command

Run `make test` to run everything we have!


## Tests

We use `pytest` and `flake8` for quality control.
We also use [wemake_python_styleguide](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-styleguide) to enforce the code quality.

To run all tests:

```bash
pytest
```

To run linting:

```bash
flake8 .
```
These steps are mandatory during the CI.


## Type checks

We use `mypy` to run type checks on our code.
To use it:

```bash
mypy mc_plugin_helper tests/**/*.py
```

This step is mandatory during the CI.

## Before submitting

Before submitting your code please do the following steps:

1. Run `pytest` to make sure everything was working before
2. Add any changes you want
3. Add tests for the new changes
4. Edit documentation if you have changed something significant
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a quick summary of your changes
6. Run `pytest` again to make sure it is still working
7. Run `mypy` to ensure that types are correct
8. Run `flake8` to ensure that style is correct
9. Run `doc8` to ensure that docs are correct
